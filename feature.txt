Version 1.0

Does:
  - Translate a HOL formula into TFF format.
  - Print the formula into a TFF file
  - Call Beagle on this TFF file
  - Return a proof 
  - Replay the proof inside HOL.

Supports:
  - Numeral and integers types
  - Instantiation of polymorphic types

To do:
  - One step replay of the proof 
  - Better normalisation (closer to Beagle internal normalisation)
  - Better way of dealing with booleans to prevent exponential instantiation
