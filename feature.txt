Version 0.2.3

Does:
  - Translate a HOL formula into TFF format.

Supports:
  formula :
  - first order formula without abstraction
  - false second order formula (!f:int->int f = g)
  - raise an exception when a function is applied to a boolean 
 
  variable:
  - use an injective mapping on free variables ( P,Q,r,s => xP,xQ,r,s )
  - use an injective mapping on undefined constant ( P,Q,r,s => cP,cQ,r,s )
  - use an injective mapping on bound varibles ( x,y => X0x,X1y ) 

  type:
  - numeral (num => $int)
  - boolean (bool => $o)
  - use an injective mapping ( rational,real => ty1rational,ty2real) 
    and append an indicative type

  axiom:
  - add an axiom for numeral (i.e x=y is translated to x > 0 and y > 0 and x=y)

  problems library:
  - 5 boolean problems
  - 1 numeral problem
  - 1 type test

Remarks : 
  - all the injective mappings joined together are injective as a global functions, so no clashes can occurs
