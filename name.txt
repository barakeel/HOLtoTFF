FUNCTIONS
  separate different objects by an underscore in functions.
  
COUPLE  
  couple: (a,b)
  record: {a = a, b = b}
  
TYPE DECLARATION
in functions or terms or record : a:int 
outside functions a : int
for tff : use simple and compound
for hol : use leaf and node

HOL CONSTANT
  filename: constant
  function: const
  value: const 
  alone: c or in a non-ambiguous long name
  
NAME
  filename: name
  function: name
  value: name
 
LIST
  filename: list
  function: list | l
  value: l   
  element: elem
  head: a
  tail: m
  
TERM
  value: term | t
  free variable: fv 
  constant: c
  term (type bool): bterm
  free term: ft
  
  
THM , GOAL
  theorem : thm | th
  theorem from a conversion : eqthm
  theorem without hypothesis : axiom
  conjecture : conjecture
  theorem list , goal : problem | pb
  
TYPE 
  type for variables: ty
  type alone inside a function: type
  boolean: bool
  numeral: num
  defined tff type: dtyname
 
FUNCTION
  use get if it's direct
  use extract if it's indirect
  put the result first and then the arguments in the name of the function
  use 2,3,4 for auxilary functions
  use 1,2 for multiple variables of the same name
