RULES
  separate different objects by an underscore in functions.
  write couple and record like this (a, b) ,  {a: a, b: b}
  and type declaration like this a: int
  except in signature a : b

HOL CONSTANT
  filename: constant
  function: const
  value: const 
  alone: c or in a non-ambiguous long name
  
NAME
  filename: name
  function: name
  value: name
 
LIST
  filename: list
  function: l
  value: l   
  element: el 
  head: a
  tail: m
  
TERM
  value: t | term
  free variable: fv 
  constant: c
  term (type bool): prop
  
THM  
  theorem : thm
  equational theorem : eqthm
  theorem derived from ASSUME : assume
  axiom : axiom
  conjecture : conjecture
  
TYPE 
  type for variables: ty
  type alone inside a function: type
  boolean: bool
  numeral: num
 
FUNCTION
  use get if it's direct
  use extract if it's indirect
  put the result first and then the arguments in the name of the function
  use 2,3,4 for auxilary functions
  use 1,2 for multiple variables of the same name
