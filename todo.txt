Test:
- test the proof replayer
- test the change made to the higher order conversion step

Cleaning:
- rewrite conversions in a shorter and more readable way
- rewrite BEAGLE proof output and reader.

Infer axioms from a theory:
- do it manually for each constant (COND (if then else) should be translated first)
- check inside the numconv if COND for integer was used to translate a difference.

Output:
- add comments to be printed in the standard input when the file is generated
- add comments to the file if the user wants to (tptp standard comment)
 
Documentation:
- explanation of what each signature function does.

Pretty printing:
- to be done
