pretty printing:
- to be done
  
monomorph: 
- to be extended to bound variables 
  (don't know how without exponential cases

testing:
- include examples from metis_tac
- create a call to beagle from inside the project (use shell script)

output:
- print boolean to two different type depending on the situation
- choose what to do inside the formula and what to do outside
- create all dict on a term list
- add boolean axioms 
- add numeral axioms 
- add function axioms 
- add app axioms
- add comments to be printed in the standard input when the file is generated
- add comments to the file if the user wants to (tptp standard comment)

 
documentation:
- explanation of what each signature function does.

rewriting:   
- abstraction:
- boolean:
- higher order: add app constant
 

infer axiom from a theory:
- do it manually for each constant
  
product:
- particular case of a constant
