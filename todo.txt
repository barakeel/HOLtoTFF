ISSUES

betaeta reduction 
  after beta-eta red use some trick to remove lambda abstraction.
  
pretty printing
  just do it

functionnality
  boolTheory ( not even there )
  
type
  change substring and use String.size 
  

CODE QUESTIONS

   instantiation of bound variables to specific types
   Why can't the user do it ? Because if we generate all the possible instantiation (possible but it will be big)
   nbty      number of different types ( generally 10 to 100 ) 
   nbalphaty number of different alpha type to be instantiate 
   nbty ^ nbalphaty number of instantiation

TODO

comments
  add comments to be printed in the standard input when the file is generated
  add comments to the file if the user wants to  provide some 
  tptp comments; File Domain Problem Bersion English Refs: Source: Names Status
 
documentation
  explanation of what each signature function does to be added easily to holdoc.

free variable
  Use a dictionnary to make the code more readable
  Use the implemented dictionnary for types
  

modify hol formula
  
  include definition and do monomorphisme
  replacing definition 
  beta-eta reduction lambda-abstraction
  skolemisation

create a tree to represent my formula
change the tree to make it first order

use dictionnaries to undo conflicts between variables 
create a new tree with the name of everything
output the tree (very easy)

higher order ( today and tomorrow )
  only add "app" if a term of arity 0 is applied to one ore more constant
  different "app" for different number of arguments and type

product
  verify if it's working correctly i think it 's not 

infer axiom
  use dest_var dest_thy_const
  replace the use of dest_const by dest_thy_const to add the axioms of the theory pair*)
