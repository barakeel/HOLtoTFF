Question :
- How to prove the negation of the formula from a saturated clause set?
  (only can be done by extracting a model)
  (should give the negation of the thm back to beagle)
- How to translate a rule or something that produces a theorem into a tactic?
- How tactic works ?
 
Pretty printing:
- to be done
  
Infer axiom from a theory:
- do it manually for each constant
  
Monomorph: 
- to be extended to bound variables 
  (don't know how without exponential cases) (ask Chantal Keller)

Testing:
- include examples from metis_tac
- test product

Rewriting:   
- take care of variables names: 
  - new variables should be used when adding variables
  - maybe create list to remembers which variables were added
  - maybe write my own cnf_conv but not necessary
- outside beagle:   
  - clause set ? 
- inside beagle :
  - clause set ?

Output:
- add comments to be printed in the standard input when the file is generated
- add comments to the file if the user wants to (tptp standard comment)
- print_thm 
  - should returns every dictionary created 
 
Documentation:
- explanation of what each signature function does.
